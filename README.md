## NOTES

Since the guidelines mentioned to submit "a single HTML", I decided to recreate only the home page.
  - All static assets are loaded from the same source as webmd.com
  - Some of the links will redirect to the actual WebMD website

I hope I followed the requirements correctly. I usually develop with React, so this was a fun challenge and a nice change of pace to recreate using just 1 HTML file.
